# Hangman Game

Welcome to my first game project using Python! This is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game.

## Introduction

Hangman is a word-guessing game where the player tries to guess a secret word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. In this implementation, you get 15 lives to guess the secret word before you are "hanged."

## Features

- Randomly selects a word from a predefined list of 2258 words.
- Allows the player to input guesses.
- Tracks the number of lives remaining.
- Displays the current state of the guessed word.
- Informs the player if they have already guessed a letter or if they have guessed an invalid character.
- Ends the game when the word is guessed correctly or when the player runs out of lives.

## Installation for your terminal

1. Clone the repository:
```git clone https://github.com/sharif-islam96403/Hangman-Game.git```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```cd Hangman-Game```
3. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. This game was developed using Python 3.10.
   ```open Hangman.py```

Enjoy the game! Feel free to contribute or provide feedback.
